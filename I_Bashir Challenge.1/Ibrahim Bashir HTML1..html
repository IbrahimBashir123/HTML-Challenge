        <h2>Hello, <u>Nature for People.</u> <br /><span>WWF is partnering with the IFRC, the world’s largest humanitarian network, to work with nature and protect people from the climate crisis.</span></h2><br>
                <h3>How does the natural environment affect mental health?</h3>
                <p>If you visit a local park, garden, or beach, you may notice there is less noise, and there are less people and fewer sources of stress. Sunlight, fresh air, plant life, open spaces, and the natural environment can lead to lower stress levels and have an overall positive impact on wellbeing.</p>
